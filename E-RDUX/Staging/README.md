# Entanglement Pre-Release

### Warning: This mod is still WIP and is not final yet!

An alternative multiplayer mod for BONEWORKS written with performance and scalability in mind!

This mod uses Steamworks (Steam lobbies + P2P) networking, so Steam must be running and the game must be launched through Steam. Invite friends through the Steam overlay or browse public lobbies in-game!

Join our discord server! https://discord.gg/FmRGBgbc3N

Check out the git repo for the source code: https://gitlab.com/zCubed3/entanglement-public

# Changelog
### **v0.2.0 - Current**
- Added CustomMaps 2.0 and r2modman support
- Added playermodel r2modman support (hasn't been tested so might not work, everything else has though)
- Notifications! (Player leave, join, disconnect, join server, leave server)
- AUTOMATIC NPC SYNCING! (You no longer have to grab them! Might not always work but thats what you have to accept with a multiplayer mod)
- Custom maps objects sync more reliably
- Updated to MelonLoader 0.5.2 and updated logging to LoggerInstance (better performance when logging)
- Custom weapons no longer spawn magazines at the map spawn that lag your game
- Holstered objects disable collision so objects with broken holster points don't destroy a bunch of objects
- Non-broken pieces no longer remain after destroying an object
- Having discord closed when starting the game no longer breaks gunshots

### **v0.1.1**
- Added heartbeat system (if the client has not received a message from the server in over 40 seconds they will disconnect)
- NOTICE: If someone with 0.1.1 joins someone with 0.1.0, they will be disconnected after 40 seconds since they won't receive the heartbeats.
